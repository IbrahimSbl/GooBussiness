# GooBussiness

<ol>
    <li>The services section of GooBussiness is maked as a <b>card view</b>.</li>
    <li>The icons are imported from <b>FontAwesome</b>.</li>
    <li>I tried not to use more colors to keep the design compatible somehow with the current color scheme.</li>
    <li>I've added some transitions to add more life to the section.</li>
</ol>
