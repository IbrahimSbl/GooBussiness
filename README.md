# GooBussiness

## Project 01
<ol>
    <li>The services section of GooBussiness is maked as a <b>card view</b>.</li>
    <li>The icons are imported from <b>FontAwesome</b>.</li>
    <li>I tried not to use more colors to keep the design compatible somehow with the current color scheme.</li>
    <li>I've added some transitions to add more life to the section.</li>
</ol>

## Project 02
<ol>
    <li>I was planning to hide and show the order form but I saw it is better to keep it visible then force the user to choose a plan.</li>
    <li>I keep the style simple , obvious to be easy to implemented dynamically. </li>
</ol>

## Project 03
<ol>
    <li>You can Access the contact us section from the navbar.</li>
    <li>The form contains a validation which forces the user to insert Name, Email, Subject and Message.</li>
    <li>Also it validates the email using Regex.</li>
    <li>As all the work done before the code is concise, readable and clear. Tailed with commands for understandability.</li>
    <li>The form is fully responsive.</li>
</ol>
